Some basic ("essential") add-ons for Douglas Crockford's excellent [RQ][1] library.
Most of them quite influenced by RQ's [official documentation][2].

This library is dependant on [async-rq][3], a CommonJS compliant fork of RQ. 
RQ is [not][4] CommonJS compliant.

### Usage

Documentation and usage examples will be added towards v0.1.0.
Then this library will be published to [npm][10], I guess.
